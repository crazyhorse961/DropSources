# SourceDrops
A premium resource on spigot, but, at same time, also open source!

# Why Open Sourcing?
I'm starting to love Open Sourcing!
It lets other learn, and it also helps me improving the plugin

# Why Open Source and at the same time Premium
Well, the premium version is dedicated to peoples that wish to contribute more than they're altready doing, or, for peoples that don't know
how to build a plugin from source, or just wish to update the plugin faster :P.

# How i can contribute?
Posting an issue, a pull request and forking the project!
